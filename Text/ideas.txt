Language will be transpiled either to C or C++, not entirely sure yet.
Ideally it will look similar to C++, but eliminate much of the technical debt.


C++ Issues to Fix:
    Verbose Syntax
    Library Features that should be in the Language
    Symbols and Keywords used in too many different contexts
        -Ex: static, inline, &, etc
    Most Vexing Parse
    Some features implemented using TMP should just be determined directly by compiler (ex std::is_same_v)
    Pointer constness is confusing
    

Possible Features:
    Make smart pointer types inbuilt. 
      Ex: uniqueptr<int>, smartptr<int>, rawptr<int>...

    Make the get address operator @ instead of &, also not overloadable
    All constructors explicit by default
    All returning functions [[nodiscard]] by default
    All functions noexcept by default
    null instead of nullptr
    Explicit junk initialization 
      (int x = junk; int y; //error)

    Comparison operators now keywords (and, equals, not, etc)
    cast<type> for static cast
    cast_if<type> for dynamic cast
    unsafe_cast<type> for reinterpret cast
    Pattern matching
    Do While loop can use variable in block inside while condition

    Classes with one a member of a unique type (no other member with that type), that member may be referred to solely by type name
      struct Example{
          int x;
          int y;

          Car;
        }

      Example a;
      a.x = 5; a.y = 2; a.Car.drive();

      Helps in situations where variable would have same name as type?

    Variants implemented as template list of types 
      <int, float, char> x;
    Nullable types implemented by means of variant. 
      <int, devoid> x;

    Instead of using static for scoped functions, mark 'private' or 'public'
    Optional Garbage Collector? Allow normal pointers for performance but allow for special memory handling as well.
    Allow variable to become const at some point 
      Ex: int x = 5; x += 2; constify(?) x;
    Namespaces not allowed, instead use from statement
      from standard: vector as vec;
      from <lib>: <name> as <imported name>
      from <lib>: <name>; for keeping same name

      Forward declarations must use 'extern'. Solves most vexing parse.
      Multiple passes allows for more flexibility, no need for forward declarations anywhere but headers.
      Global variable initialization must be specified with 'global' function.
        int x;
        float y;
        global_init{
            y = 5;
            int z = y * 3; //z is not global, only for initialization purposes
            x = z + 1;
          }
        global_destruction{

            //...
          }
      Global variables may not be initialize/destruct with functions or data external to their file.
      Global function/keyword may only be used once per file, only in global scope.
